# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this used for?

This is intended to be a comparison tool, so likely it could be used in research, or if any
of the output turns out to be useful for evaluating some other state (compatibility, security, etc.)
it could be used for that.

## I have an idea for a comparison!

Wonderful! This project is hopefully useful for someone other than myself, and if you
have an idea for how to make it better I want to hear from you! Please [get in contact with us](support).
