> compare environments and other things between containers, and host 📦️

This is a simple tool to compare environments and other features of containers. 

For environments, this means the environment on your host vs a container, or the environment between containers. The tool here also implmements
a basic interface to interact with several container technologies, which could
be extended to other projects.

## TODO

 - allow setting a different container backend via environment
